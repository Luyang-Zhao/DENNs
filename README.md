# DENNs: Discontinuity-Embedded Neural Networks
This repository contains the implementation of Discontinuity-Embedded Neural Networks (DENNs). For a detailed description of the method, please refer to the paper: [DENNs: Discontinuity-Embedded Neural Networks for fracture mechanics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782525004566?via%3Dihub). 

The repository includes numerical examples such as Mode I crack, bi-material interface crack, intersecting cracks, and crack propagation.
